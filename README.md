Big Market Sales Prediction
üìä Overview
This project aims to predict the sales of various products in different Big Market outlets. By analyzing a dataset of product and outlet information, we develop a machine learning model to forecast future sales, which can help in strategic business planning and inventory management.

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, including data analysis, pre-processing, and model training.

üìÅ Project Structure
notebooks/: Contains the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files for the project.

data/: Stores the raw dataset (bigmarket.csv).

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: To understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and find missing values or anomalies.

Key Activities:

Visualizing the distribution of numerical features using distribution plots (displot).

Visualizing the counts of categorical features using count plots (countplot).

Identifying the most important factors influencing sales.

2. Data Pre-processing
Objective: To clean and transform the raw data into a suitable format for the machine learning model.

Key Activities:

Handling missing values (e.g., in Item_Weight and Outlet_Size).

Label Encoding: Converting categorical features (e.g., Outlet_Location_Type) into numerical form.

Handling other data inconsistencies.

3. Model Building & Evaluation
Objective: To train a predictive model and evaluate its performance.

Key Activities:

Splitting Data: Separating the features (X) from the target variable (y, Item_Outlet_Sales).

Train-Test Split: Dividing the dataset into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Training Algorithm: Using a TensorFlow/Keras-based algorithm to train the model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance on the test set using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
